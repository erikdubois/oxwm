Oxwm

A dynamic window manager written in Rust, inspired by dwm but designed to evolve beyond it. OXWM features a clean, functional Lua API for configuration with hot-reloading support, ditching the suckless philosophy of “edit + recompile”. Instead, we focus on lowering friction for users with sane defaults, LSP-powered autocomplete, and instant configuration changes without restarting your X session.
